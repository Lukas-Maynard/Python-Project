
I have had many problems with this project.
There have been to many to remember fully but here are some of the bigger ones.
---------------------------------------------
FIXED PROBLEMS:
	
Almost all of the problems are Tab related.	
- Tabs all had the same textbox.
- Closing file closed all files/ other tab contents.
- Creating new tabs didn't include textboxes.

---------------------------------------------
CURRENT KNOWN PROBLEMS:
- When clicking cancel while opening file a new tab is still made.
- Pasting with the edit menu doesn't work if text was copyed/cut with keybinds first.
- Pasting with edit meny while multiple tabs are open pastes only on the last tab.
- If there are a large amount of tabs, closing them in a strange order will sometimes cause some to have their textbox deleted.
- Save As only saves the last file in the tab list.
- Aspect ratio is strange on other devices and resizability is not currently working
